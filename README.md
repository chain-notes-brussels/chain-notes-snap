🫰 Always falling for rugs and scams?

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Bounties

### Worldcoin

### Metamask Linea

We created a metamask snap ([in a seperate repo](https://github.com/chain-notes-brussels/snap)) and deployed to Linea.


### Zircuit - Best Project on Zircuit

We deployed our contracts on Zircuit and manually added the config for the frontend, since this is not available yet in viem and scaffold. Getting testnet tokens and deploying on Zircuit was very smooth. Only hickup we encountered was that we had to manually add network config on the frontend.
